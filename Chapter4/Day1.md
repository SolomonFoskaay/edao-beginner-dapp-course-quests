#### QUESTION 1: 
Create a new smart contract in Cadence that has at least the following two things:

- A function to change that variable

After, deploy that contract to the same testnet account you generated today.

#### ANSWER: 
Contract named "HelloWeb3" successfully deployed to testnet as seen in the screenshot below:

#### QUESTION 3:

#### ANSWER: 
I used "Transaction" to successfully changed the variable "myNumber" from the deployed "HelloWeb3" contract on testnet (from 0 to 365) as seen in the screenshot below

Below is a screenshot of me reading the changed variable from 0 to 365 using the Flow CLI

#### QUESTION 5: 
Go to https://flow-view-source.com/testnet/. Where it says "Account", paste in the Flow address you generated and click "Go". On the left hand side, you should see your "HelloWorld" contract and your new contract. Isn't it so cool to see them live on Testnet? Then, send the URL to the page.
- EXAMPLE: https://flow-view-source.com/testnet/account/0x90250c4359cebac7/

#### ANSWER: 
Here is the link: https://flow-view-source.com/testnet/account/0xb3e2d05cf2cdb97a
